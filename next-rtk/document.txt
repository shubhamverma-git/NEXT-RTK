Step 1: Create a folder name 'Store' in src.
Step 2: Create a file in 'Store' folder named index.js
Step 3: Import 'configureStore'. This will work as a wrapper of all redux slices(reducer).
Step 4: Create 'reducers' named folder in 'Store'. Create a file 'cartReducer.js' in it.
Step 5: Import 'createSlice' then make const cartSlice with 'name', initialState, 'reducers'.
