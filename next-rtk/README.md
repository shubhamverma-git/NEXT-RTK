NEXT JS and RTK - STEP BY STEP

Main components of Redux are Action, Reducer, Store and Dispatcher. We keep Action and Reducer in same file and that file is known as Slice.
Slice is a combination of Action and Reducer or (Action + Reducer).

RTK FLOW - First we dispatch the data from the app and this dispatching of data is know as Action. Middleware who send Action data to store is known as Reducer. With the help of Reducer we save the data in store. In the last Store save the data whatever reducer sent.

Step 1: First make the folder in src or app (app is recommended) and make three files with the name store.js, slice.js, provider.js

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
